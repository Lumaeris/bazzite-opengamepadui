# Bazzite with [OpenGamepadUI](https://github.com/ShadowBlip/OpenGamepadUI) [WIP]

## To-do

* [x] Add a way to switch to desktop mode (only on my fork for now)
* * "Exit" button acts like "Restart Steam" on Steam Gaming Mode, probably rename that as well.
* [ ] Change boot animation
* [x] Somehow add a screen keyboard?
* * Apparently after selecting the “Steam Deck” controller, it realized it needed to bring up the keyboard. It's not perfect, but it's something at least.
* [ ] Open the Steam minified UI when opening any Steam game
* [x] Add a way to automate installing the latest RPMs
* [ ] Add an ujust script to turn off OGUI in favor of Steam Gaming Mode

Note: In my testings InputPlumber takes over the Steam Controller entirely, so it's not ideal for now to use it properly on Desktop mode and switching to Steam Gaming Mode using ujust script, which doesn't exist yet. For now if you rebased and want Steam Gaming Mode back or use desktop mode, you have to rollback to official Bazzite-Deck image for the time being.

## Installation

To rebase an existing Bazzite-Deck installation to the latest build (add `-gnome` before `:latest` if you're using GNOME):

- First rebase to the unsigned image, to get the proper signing keys and policies installed:
  ```
  rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/lumaeris/bazzite-opengamepadui:latest
  ```
- Reboot to complete the rebase:
  ```
  systemctl reboot
  ```
- Then rebase to the signed image, like so:
  ```
  rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/lumaeris/bazzite-opengamepadui:latest
  ```
- Reboot again to complete the installation
  ```
  systemctl reboot
  ```

The `latest` tag will automatically point to the latest build.

## Verification

These images are signed with [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/)'s [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign). You can verify the signature by downloading the `cosign.pub` file from this repo and running the following command:

```bash
cosign verify --key cosign.pub ghcr.io/lumaeris/bazzite-opengamepadui
cosign verify --key cosign.pub ghcr.io/lumaeris/bazzite-opengamepadui-gnome
```
